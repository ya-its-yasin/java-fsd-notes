common code usefull for multitple components,, we should put in service


ng new test-app -> creates an angular app
ng serve -> starts the application in port 4200


productService.saveProduct(this.product).subscribe( (data) => { console.log }, error=> console.log(error));

saveProduct(product: Product): Observable<Object>{
return this.http.post("http://localhost:8080/product/v1/create/", product); 
}


Angular supports only constructor injection

build fron end in this format
Model -> service -> component(is like controller)
