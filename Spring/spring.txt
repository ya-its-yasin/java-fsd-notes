Spring

why spring bacame popular?
rod johnson rasied a question, why are we doing java like this.. and he introduced spring.

**spring helps java developers in agile development by providing proxy objects and eliminates dependencies aross project

create maven project and add 'spring-core' and 'spring-context' dependencies

-> we create an object Alien obj.
Alien obj = new Alien();
-> no please.. we dont want to handle it..
how?
-> Dependency Injection or IOC -> Inversion Of Control
-> by asking spring to create object of this class.

getBean(); 
-> is responsible to give object.
-> this method belongs to an interface.
-> then it should belong to some library..
-> that library is called 'spring-context'

// creating a context mothod to get all beans from the beans.xml file
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml"); 

-> this will give us an ApplicationContext
-> this is a spring container
-> its responsibilities to create objects..
-> creates objects of classes which are mentioned as bean in the xml file..

<!-- bean definitions here -->
<bean name="alien" class="com.tcs.ioc.Alien"> </bean>

Alien obj1 = (Alien) context.getBean("alien");
Alien obj2 = (Alien) context.getBean("alien");

-> in both refrences, we get same instance of A
-> this default behaviour is called singleton
-> we can avoid this and get different instances by setting this property as prototype.

<bean name="alien" class="com.tcs.ioc.Alien" scope="singleton/prototype" ></bean>

-> object is created by spring..
-> that means the constructor will be called by spring
-> we can set default value to those object by giving them in the xml itself

<bean name="alien" class="com.tcs.ioc.Alien" scope="singleton/prototype" >
<propperty name="age" value=10> </property> </bean>


in the world there are 3 but spring supports 2 types of injections
1. setter injection
2. constructor injection

refer this project for a good idea about this concept
-> https://github.com/ya-its-yasin/Java-FSD/tree/main/day8-springioc/src/main/java/com/tcs/ioc


IOC - inversion of control -> making low level items to depend on high level items

in the world there are 3 but spring supports 2 types of injections
1. setter injection
2. constructor injection
----------

setter injection
- a class must have a setter method to inject an object into it.

public class B{
A a; // in java it is an instance variable,,, but in spring.. this is no more an instance variable,, this is a dependency
public void setA(A a){ this.a = a;}
}


BeanFactory interface 
- a root interface for accessing Spring bean container

DTD - Document Type Definition
- it is going to validate XML file

spring says,, give me all the beans in beans.xml file,, then i'll bring you all dependencies

https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html#:~:text=When%20you%20create%20a%20bean,instances%20from%20a%20single%20recipe.

**one of the main feature of spring is Autowiring, 
which is introduced first time in programming where the container will detect the dependency and automatically inject

autowire type - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_beans_autowiring.htm#:~:text=Autowiring%20by%20property%20datatype.,beans%20name%20in%20configuration%20file.

byName, byType autowiring use set method of the class

Can we instantiate one class two times in beans.xml? if so will it still be singleton? 
if we get byName with different names then yes it is possible..
if we take byType, then it is not possible

xml based cofigurations are not used nowadays...
everything became annotation based...

@component indicates it is a special type of annotation to mention that spring will provide something to the class
@service
@repository
@controller


DTD became older..
later.. 'XML schema' cmae to validate XML documents

----------------------
Spring MVC - is a architechtural pattern and not a design pattern

challenges will be faced if our servlet containers..
-> contain business logic
-> presentation login
-> request processing logic

MVC is all about decoupling these three layers

Controller 
-> directly or indirectly a servlet
-> request from web hits the controller first

Model 
-> makes changes and stores values 
-> this has business logic and data access logic also will have state of objects
-> model is like Entity in hibernate

View
-> we build view with the help of data from the model

https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html

Dispatcher servlet is the front controller of the application

interceptors or preprocessors will execute common logics for all the code
Simple and Straightforward

What?
Interceptor is a components which intercets request so that you can perform some task before and after request reaches its handler

How to use it?
Implement HandlerInterceptor annotate it with “@Component”. Spring will autodetech it from scaning pacakage
You can define in xml configuration also.

------------------------


spring supports injection of objects to its parent interface

good way of software development si to create an iterface first and a concrete class for it

ApplicationContext 
- in enterprise applciations, context is where bindings happen
- it is going to create a cintainer more powerfull than bean container.. and ninds all beans in side the container
