spring profile is a feature fo spring to support environment specific configurations in a better way.

application-<profileName>.yml/properties

spring.profiles.active=test
->this allow to set profiles and different properties for each env in diff prop files..

then, one more thing..
we can decide the classes which are to be loaded in which profile..
for example

@Repository
@Profile("prod")
public class DataSourceBean{
	
}

@Repository
@Profile("dev")
public class LocalDataSourceBean{
	
}

by setting the spring profile in the properties file..
we can decide which class needs to be loaded at which time.
