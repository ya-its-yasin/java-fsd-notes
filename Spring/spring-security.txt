Spring security provides features to authentication and authorization for our application.

adding spring boot starter security in the pom file will automatically secure all endpoints of the application.

there are possibilities of many ways for Auths
1. in memory 
2. jdbc
3. LDAP
4. custom/plugin

passwords are stroed as 
{noop}test123
{bcrypt}encryptedpassword

JDBC auth:
have two tables in database:
1. users (username, password, enabled) 
2. authorities (username, authority) -> authority means roles

@Bean
public UserDetailsManager userDetailsManager(DataSource dataSource){
	return new JdbcUserDetailsManager(dataSource);
}

thats it, springboot will take care of all the authentication and authorization with the use of these two tables and 3 lines of config code.
