AOP is not developing software...
it is like wrapping the softwares in to another layer...
it will monitor the application activities.. based on pointcut

main concept is taking all logging code and centralize in an aspect

AOP is based on a design pattern - proxy


aspect
-> class that we create for aop is as Aspect

advice
-> log method that we write in aspect class

Join point
-> the real methods to which the advice methods are pointing too

pointcut
-> is a bridge between an advice and our code

weaving
-> linking happens in run time

types of advice:
-> Before advice
-> After returning advice
-> After throwing advice
-> after (finally) advice
-> Around advice
