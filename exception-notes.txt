Exceptions are very dangerous to developers..

no matter how good we are at coding, if client sees an exception in the application page, we are zero.

-> instead of directly letting the exception to occur
-> we have to send it in the response in the form of json

refer -> /day13-boot-rest-exceptions project

-> customizing the exception handling
-> we have externalized the exception handling, our contrller is not handling any exceptions now
