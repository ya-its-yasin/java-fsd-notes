Project 2: Building an Automated Investment Portfolio Management System
1. Introduction:
Investment portfolio management is crucial for individuals and organizations to optimize their financial assets and achieve their investment goals. However, manual portfolio management processes are often time-consuming, error-prone, and lack real-time insights. Our project aims to develop an Automated Investment Portfolio Management System using Java Full Stack technologies to address these challenges.
2. Problem Description:
Traditional investment portfolio management involves manual tracking of asset allocations, rebalancing, and performance analysis, which can be inefficient and prone to human error. Additionally, lack of real-time insights and analytics hinders informed decision-making. Our project seeks to automate these processes, providing users with a robust platform for managing their investment portfolios efficiently and effectively.
3. Objectives:
●	Develop an intuitive web-based application for managing investment portfolios.
●	Implement automated asset allocation and rebalancing algorithms to optimize portfolio performance.
●	Provide real-time insights and analytics on portfolio composition, performance, and risk.
●	Enable users to set investment goals, and risk preferences, and monitor progress towards achieving them.
●	Integrate with external financial data sources for accurate and up-to-date market information.
4. Scope of Work:
The project will include the following key features:
●	User registration and authentication: Investors can register and securely log in to access portfolio management services.
●	Portfolio creation and customization: Users can create personalized investment portfolios based on their goals and risk preferences.
●	Asset allocation and rebalancing: Automated algorithms will optimize portfolio asset allocation and periodically rebalance to maintain desired targets.
●	Performance analytics: Provide detailed insights into portfolio performance, including returns, volatility, and historical performance.
●	Risk assessment: Evaluate portfolio risk metrics and provide recommendations for risk management strategies.
●	Integration with financial APIs: Retrieve real-time market data for accurate portfolio valuation and analysis.
5. Technologies:
The project will be developed using Java Full Stack technologies, including:
●	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular/React/Vue.js for building the user interface.
●	Backend: Java, Spring Boot for RESTful API development, Hibernate for database interaction.
●	Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for storing user profiles, portfolios, transactions, and market data.
●	Security: OAuth for authentication, HTTPS for secure communication, and encryption algorithms for data protection.
6. Deliverables:
●	Functional Automated Investment Portfolio Management System with all specified features implemented.
●	User documentation and guides for seamless onboarding and usage.
●	Source code repository with version control (e.g., Git) for collaboration and future enhancements.
7. Project Timeline:
The project will be executed in multiple phases, including:
●	Requirements gathering and analysis.
●	Designing the system architecture and database schema.
●	Implementation of frontend and backend modules.
●	Integration with external financial APIs and testing.
●	User acceptance testing and feedback incorporation.
●	Deployment and maintenance phase
