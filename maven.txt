maven

-> Apache Maven is a project maanagement tool
-> most popular use of maven is for build management and dependencies

what problems does maven solve?
-> tell maven, the projects that you are working with.. (dependencies / jars)
-> maven will go to internet and download it and mek it ready during project compliation or run for you

how maven works?
-> we mention the dependencies in pom file
-> maven checks or the dependencies in local
-> if not present, then it goes to maven central repository website and downloads and keeps in the local
-> and have it ready to use in the project

Maven provides a standard project structure to work with universally.

POM.xml
-> Project Object Model file
-> config file present in root of project

POM structure:
1. project meta data -> project name, version, java version ,jar type etc etc
2. dependencies
3. plugins -> additional custom tasks

Project Coordinates
-> GAV
-> Group ID, Artifact ID, Version

Group ID -> Name of company or like a package name com.yasin
Artifact ID -> Name of this project
Version -> yeah, just the version

mvnw is maven wrapper files 
-> automatically downloads correct version of mave if not present in the system ad run maven
